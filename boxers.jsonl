  "description": "A powerful knockout artist, Anthony Joshua helped revitalize the heavyweight division. Although he started his boxing career somewhat late, he quickly ascended up the amateur ranks and ended up winning an Olympic gold medal at super heavyweight, and then later the IBF heavyweight title, making him only the second British boxer to win gold at the Olympics and also a world title.\nBorn in Watford, England to Nigerian parents, Joshua spent his early years back and forth between the United Kingdom and Nigeria. By the middle of his Year Seven, he was in the United Kingdom full time at Kings Langley Secondary School. He was always a natural athlete, as he did well in football and also ended up breaking the 100-meter record for Year Nine students when he ran it in just 11.6 second.\nWhile he did a couple sessions of boxing training with his father at 15, he wasn\u2019t interested in the sport at the time, preferring weightlifting and spending time with his friends. In 2007 when he was 18, he really committed to the sport and started training full time. This meant he was getting to it later than most, although athletic heavyweights can get away with that.\nHe had immediate success when he started competing as an amateur, as he ended up winning both the 2009 and 2010 Haringey Box Cup, followed by the Senior ABA Championships in 2010. Despite his success in the ring, Anthony Joshua had his share of problems outside of it. He had been getting in trouble with the law since he was 16, at one point throwing another player over his shoulders during a game of football. That resulted in an official warning. He also got in his fair share of street fights, one of which led to him being on remand in Reading. His success in boxing didn\u2019t lead him down the right path immediately, as even after he started collecting those amateur tournament trophies, he still got arrested in 2010 for having marijuana in his car.\nDespite these issues, the heavyweight didn\u2019t let himself get off track, as he continued to focus on his goals of winning tournaments. Despite an offer of 50,000 pounds to fight professionally in 2010, he turned it down because he wanted to remain an amateur. He instead took a place on the GB Boxing team, and he ended up winning the 2010 GB Amateur Boxing Championships. He took a step up in competition the next year when he fought in the 2011 European Amateur Boxing Championships, but a southpaw, Mihai Nistor, ended up stopping him.\nThe 2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships served as a coming out party for the boxer. Despite having only 4 years of experience at the time, he beat the tournament\u2019s reigning champion Roberto Cammarelle and followed it up with a victory in the semifinals. He faced off with Magomedrasul Majidov in the finals but lost by just a point, ending up with the silver medal. His tournament performance was good enough to earn him a place in the 2012 Olympics.\nHis draw at the Olympics was far from easy, and he had a tough opening round against Cuban Erislandy Sav\u00f3n. He ended up taking a close and highly controversial victory, 17-16, although most of the people in the crowd didn\u2019t agree with it. His next bout was a more decisive 15-11 victory over Zhang Zhilei, who he knocked down in the second round. The semifinals saw the 6\u20196\u201d boxer at a rare height disadvantage against Ivan Dychko, but he still managed to prevail with another close victory, this one coming 13-11. In the finals, he once again fought Roberto Cammarelle, and this match was far closer.\nHe lost the first two rounds by 1 and 2 points, respectively, but then stormed back in the third round to tie it up at 18-18. On the countback, he was crowned the winner. Like his first fight, this result also attracted some controversy, although fans were impressed with the way he fought back in the final round.\nHaving conquered the highest level of amateur boxing, Anthony Joshua turned pro in 2013. In his very first contest on October 5, 2013, he showed off his devastating power with a first-round knockout win against Emanuele Leo. He continued to pick up knockouts and TKOs on his way to a WBC heavyweight title fight against Denis Bakhtov at the 02 Arena in London. In front of his home crowd, he dominated Bakhtov and scored a second-round TKO, winning his first title just over a year into his professional career.\nAfter another four finishes, he picked up another belt when he defeated Gary Cornish by first-round TKO and won the vacant Commonwealth heavyweight title. His next fight was for the vacant British heavyweight title, along with his own WBC and Commonwealth heavyweight titles. It was also against an opponent he had a history with in Dillian Whyte. The two had fought previously as amateurs in 2009, and Whyte had picked up the win. Whyte tagged Joshua with a hard shot in the second round, but the champion showed that he could take a punch by hanging in there and fighting back, eventually knocking Whyte out in round seven. It was the longest either fighter had fought at that point in their careers.\nWith that win, he had earned his first shot at a world heavyweight title, in this case the IBF belt held by Charles Martin. The fight took place at his usual stomping grounds, the 02 Arena, and he didn\u2019t disappoint. He picked up a second-round knockout to the delight of his many fans in attendance. He would go on to defend his IBF heavyweight title multiple times.\nAs a boxer, Joshua is the total package. Despite starting late, he has sharp technical skills, and he boasts superb athleticism. And, of course, the fans love a knockout puncher, and he has shown that he possesses that kind of brutal, fight-changing power.",

  "description": "Dereck Chisora is a British professional boxer who has held the British and Commonwealth heavyweight titles as well as the European Heavyweight Title. Chisora has a rough, brawling style that can bedevil more clinical boxers.\nChisora was born in Mbare, which is a suburb of Harare, the Zimbabwe capital city. In 1999, his family moved to Finchley, London. In 2002, he was involved in a street fight and was arrested for assault after knocking out a victim\u2019s teeth. Soon after, his parole officer suggested that he take up boxing. He was trained by Joe Smyth on the fundamental aspects of boxing and turned pro in 2007.\nDereck Chisora won his first fight with a second round TKO against Istvan Kecskes. He won his next three fights by decision before fighting future Commonwealth Champion Sam Sexton. He won by TKO with 30 seconds left in the final round. He went onto win his first eight fights before being suspended for four months for biting Paul Butlin in their 2009 fight. This suspension caused him to miss his scheduled fight for the British title against Danny Williams.\nDereck Chisora and Williams struggled for a year to reschedule the fight before finally meeting in May 2010. Chisora won easily with a TKO in the second round, winning the British heavyweight title. In September of 2010, he defeated Sam Sexton for a second time, this time by knockout in the 9th round and gained the Commonwealth Heavyweight Title. It was in 2010 that he was found guilty of assault against his girlfriend and given a suspended 12 week prison sentence.\nHe received his first and second losses to Tyson Fury and in a split decision to Robert Helenius in Finland. The result was highly controversial and Helenius actually dropped in the rankings despite his victory. Despite the loss, Dereck was scheduled to fight Vitali Klitschko in Munich in February 2012. Klitschko had the height and reach advantage and used his length to keep Chisora, with his powerful, brawling style, from getting inside and landing body blows. Klitschko won the fight by unanimous decision. Chisora was arrested but not charged after a post fight press conference brawl with David Haye.\nAfter the brawl with Haye, the British Boxing Board of Control suspended Dereck Chisora\u2019s boxing license indefinitely under the condition that he must take anger management treatment before he would be reinstated. Despite not being reinstated, he was able to use a boxing license from another country to fight David Haye. He lost the fight by TKO after being repeatedly knocked down in the fifth round.\nChisora won his next five fights while trying to clean up his image. Gone were the pre-fight confrontations as he aimed to show more respect to his opponents. However, he lost again to Tyson Fury after he was ruled unable to continue in the tenth round. After the Fury fight, he ran off a streak of five consecutive victories. He ended 2016 with a loss to Dillian Whyte in a fight for the WBC international heavyweight title.",

  "description": "A heavyweight with truly ferocious one-punch knockout power, Deontay Wilder rode a string of KOs to become a heavyweight champion. Although he isn\u2019t the most technically sound fighter, he does possess decent fundamentals and combines that with his excellent athletic abilities to significantly outclass many opponents.\nBorn on October 22 1985 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Wilder didn\u2019t step foot in a boxing gym until he was about to turn 20, so he started training fairly late compared to most fighters. Despite that, it didn\u2019t take long for him to show star potential, as he was winning the National Golden Gloves as an underdog less than two years later. A year later, he was going to the 2008 Olympics to fight for USA Boxing as a heavyweight. He won his first match convincingly and his second by a razor-thin tiebreaker before losing in the semis to Clemente Russo. He earned the bronze medal and gave himself the nickname \u201cThe Bronze Bomber\u201d afterwards. This was in reference to the great Joe Louis, the heavyweight legend who had the nickname \u201cThe Brown Bomber\u201d and who also came from Alabama.\nHe then decided to turn pro, and he had his first fight on November 15, 2008 against Ethan Cox. Although he had only three years of experience, he stopped Cox in the second round by TKO after scoring multiple knockdowns during the fight. Stoppages would be a theme of his fights, as he then went on to build up a nine-fight streak of first-round finishes. That came to an end on April 30, 2010, when Alvaro Morales managed to make it to the third round before getting stopped by TKO.\nAlthough Deontay Wilder wasn\u2019t fighting a high level of competition early in his career, he was destroying those he did fight, and he was fighting often. His athleticism and natural ability were both on a completely different level compared to his opposition. While he can get wild at times, he has a crisp jab that does solid damage, and his straight right hand is an absolutely brutal weapon that seems to stun fighters every time it lands.\nStaying active throughout this early portion of his career, he fought seven times in 2009 and then six times per year in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Perhaps most impressive about this was how he dominated his opponents every time. All his fights ended by either KO, TKO or a corner stoppage, and none of them made it past the fourth round. He ended up compiling a 25-0 record when he earned his first title shot, against Kelvin Price on December 15, 2012 for the WBC Continental Americas heavyweight title.\nIf he felt any nerves, he certainly didn\u2019t show it, as he took a calm approach for the first two rounds before cracking Price with a right hand clean to the jaw in the third round. He scored the KO and took home the belt in front of an excited crowd at Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles, California.\nAfter a second-round TKO victory over Matthew Greer, he got a step up in competition against British fighter Audley Harrison, who was a European heavyweight champion and had won an Olympic gold medal. The fight was in Sheffield, England, which was enemy territory, but it didn\u2019t matter. In the very first round, Deontay landed his trademark right hand and put Harrison on the canvas. Just days after the fight, Harrison decided to retire.\nNext on the hit list was Siarhei Liakhovich, who had been a WBO heavyweight champion but also had a year and a half of ring rust. The result was the same \u2013 a brutal right hand by Wilder, and another devastating stoppage victory in the first round. It took Liakhovich several minutes to get up and recover his senses.\nHe then faced Nicolai Firtha, who managed to make it to round four before getting knocked out. Next up was Malik Scott, and this one was another quick, clinical first-round KO. He followed that up by knocking down Jason Gavern multiple times until the fighter\u2019s corner stopped the fight after the fourth round. That ran his record up to 32-0, with every victory coming by way of stoppage.\nHe got a shot at a world heavyweight title next as he fought Bermane Stiverne on January 17, 2015 for the WBC belt. Stiverne did what no man had done before in lasting the entire 12 rounds and even fighting back well at times. However, Deontay Wilder wasn\u2019t going to be denied, as he landed over twice as many punches and won a unanimous decision by scores of 118-109, 118-109 and 120-107. He had also shown everyone that he had the cardio to go for a full fight when necessary.\nWith his WBC title, he now had the chance to defend the championship in front of his hometown fans in Birmingham, Alabama. Fighting Eric Molina on June 13, 2015, he put on a labored performance, although he scored multiple knockdowns before knocking out the Mexican-American fighter in the ninth round. He got to perform in the same arena on September 15, 2016 when he fought Johann Duhaupas, who he took out by TKO in the 11th round.\nHis next defense came on January 16, 2016 in New York, New York against Artur Szpilka. This time around, the champion had some trouble, as Szpilka\u2019s unique style and sharp technique allowed him to dodge quite a few punches and take the first three rounds. However, by the ninth round he was down on the scorecards and knew that he had to start taking more risks, so he went toe to toe with the champion. That proved to be a mistake, as Wilder cracked the challenger with a right hand and put him to sleep.\nHe went back to Birmingham for his next two fights. First, he stopped Chris Arreola after eight rounds, but he paid a heavy price, breaking his right hand and suffering a torn bicep in the fight, which kept him out the rest of the year. He returned on February 25, 2017 to take out Gerald Washington in a fifth-round TKO.",

  "description": "A towering heavyweight fighting out of New Zealand, Joseph Parker was born in South Auckland on January 9, 1992. His father, Dempsey, was named after legendary American pugilist Jack Dempsey and trained young Joseph starting at only three years of age. When he was 10, he started training at Papatoetoe Boxing Club.\nHe began fighting as an amateur two years later when he was 12, and he ended up achieving quite a bit of success. In 2009, he won the New Zealand Golden Gloves Tournament. In 2010 and 2011, he was the nation\u2019s amateur heavyweight champion. His final amateur match was a victory over Johan Linde, the gold medalist at the 2012 Olympics, to win gold at the Belgrade annual boxing tournament.\nParker was being hyped up quite a bit before his professional debut on July 5, 2012 against Dean Garmonsway, and he performed well in scoring a second-round TKO. His next fight was a second-round KO, and then he earned two more TKOs, each time showing off improved skills and natural punching power. He showed that he had the ability to go the distance in his next fight on May 16, 2013, winning a six-round unanimous decision over Brice Ritani-Coe.\nHe took a big step up in competition for his next fight, which was against long-time heavyweight contender Francois Botha, albeit on the downside of his career. Still, Joseph Parker showed he could stop high-level fights, as he notched another TKO in round two. That earned him his first title shot on October 10, 2013, as he fought Afa Tatupu for the NZNBF heavyweight belt. Once again, it was a dominant performance, as he won again by second-round TKO.\nNext, he traveled to Oberhausen, Germany to fight Marcelo Luiz Nascimento for the PABA interim heavyweight title, which he won after winning by TKO in the seventh round. He went back to New Zealand for his next fight, where he stopped Brian Minto after seven rounds and picked up the WBO Oriental heavyweight title for his troubles. Parker would go on to defend his belts several times.\nRunning his record to 14-0, he then fought Bowie Tupou for the WBO Africa and OPBF heavyweight titles. It didn\u2019t take him long, as he won the fight by KO in the very first round. In his next fight, a third-round TKO over Kali Meehan, he added the EPBC and WBA Oceania heavyweight belts to his collection.\nNearing the end of 2016, Joseph Parker had built up an impressive 21-0 record with 18 victories by stoppage, and perhaps most impressive was how little he had been tested. With his power and skill, it was clear he had potential to be a force in the division. On December 10, 2016, he fought for the WBO heavyweight title against Andy Ruiz. It was a close, competitive contest with both men having their moments. Ruiz was the sharper fighting in the early going and towards the end of the fight, but Parker took the middle rounds, which was enough to earn him the majority decision victory. This made him the first man from New Zealand to win a major heavyweight championship.",

  "description": "A mountain of a man, Luis Ortiz has a lethal combination of punching power, technical skills and physical gifts. He stands 6\u20194 but possesses a Sonny Liston-esque 84-inch reach that gives him deceptive range. Far from a wild brawler, he is a smart, efficient tactician who manages to dispatch his opponents without taking much punishment.\nBorn on March 29, 1979 in Camag\u00fcey, Cuba, Ortiz honed his craft on the Cuban National Team, where he built up a very impressive amateur record. Some reports suggest that he ended his amateur career with a record of 343-19. Despite that, he didn\u2019t quite break through on the world stage, with his best result likely being his gold at the 2005 Panamerican Championships.\nHe was 30 years old when he made his professional debut on February 16, 2010 against Lamar Davis. It didn\u2019t last long, as he took out Davis in the first round by TKO. His next fight was another TKO victory, this one in the fourth round against Charles Davis. A few months later, he won the WBC FECARBOX heavyweight title when he defeated Kendrick Releford by unanimous decision after eight rounds.\nAfter running his record to 10-0 with most of those wins coming by KO or TKO, Luis Ortiz got a shot at the WBA Fedelatin heavyweight title. He put on another strong performance when he knocked out Luis Andres Pineda in the sixth round. Four fights later, he was facing Epifanio Mendoza for the WBC and WBO Latino heavyweight titles. He controlled the fight from the opening bell until round seven, when his opponent got disqualified for an intention blow below the belt.\nWhile Ortiz was facing primarily journeymen and past-their-prime fighters, he was taking care of business by getting finishes. His boxing ability was evident to every observer, and he was clearly confident in the ring, no doubt due to his hundreds of amateur fights. He has a relaxed punching style, which enables him to throw powerful punches without loading up, and while he has killer instinct, he doesn\u2019t chase the knockout. His footwork is also very smooth for a heavyweight.\nAfter another four finishes, he fought Joseph Rabotte, who had lost 10 consecutive fights at the time. The bout was originally ruled a third-round KO for Luis Ortiz, but was later turned into a no contest when it was determined that Rabotte actually fell out of the ring.\nWith two impressive KOs, Ortiz got a shot at the WBA interim heavyweight title on September 11, 2014. He destroyed Lateef Kayode by TKO in the very first round, but he didn\u2019t keep the belt for long, as he failed a drug test, which changed the result of the fight to a no contest.\nHe got back into action nine months later after his suspension was up and scored a first-round TKO win over Byron Polley. He then proceeded to win back that WBA interim heavyweight title when he knocked out Matias Ariel Vidondo in the third round. Three fights later he added the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight title to his collection with a unanimous decision win over Malik Scott.",

  "description": "Born on June 11, 1989 in Birmingham, West Midlands, England, Khalid Yafai has been successful at both the amateur and professional levels. Despite fighting at super flyweight, he possesses solid punching power to complement his considerable boxing skills.\nStarting his boxing training at a young age, Yafai was named Junior Sportsman of the Year by the BBC Midlands in 2005 for winning the World Cadet title. He qualified for the 2008 Olympics, but was defeated by Andry Laffita, who went on to win silver. At the 2010 European Championships, he won the silver medal. However, he wasn\u2019t able to make the 2012 Olympics boxing team, so he decided to turn pro, instead.\nHis first pro fight was on July 7, 2012 against Delroy Spencer, and it didn\u2019t last long. Khalid Yafai won after a stoppage after the second round, which is to be expected against a fighter that was 14-139-3 at the time. His next fight ended even more quickly, as he beat Richard Voros by way of first-round TKO on September 8, 2012. Exactly two weeks later, he took a decision on points after six rounds against Victor Koh.\nYafai was fairly active in the early stages of his career, fighting lower-level competition and winning handily by TKO, KO or clear victories on points. By the end of 2013, he had compiled a perfect 10-0 record, with seven of those wins coming by stoppage. This was enough to earn him a shot at the Commonwealth super flyweight title.\nThat fight was on May 21, 2014, and he fought Yaqub Kareem. In a masterful performance, he worked the body and head beautifully, eventually taking out Kareem with a hard body shot in just the third round. Next was a fight against Herald Molina for the IBF Inter-Continental super flyweight title and he looked even better, winning easily by second-round KO.\nAfter four more wins, he fought for the British super flyweight belt on October 17, 2015 against Jason Cunningham. He was the smaller man, but it didn\u2019t matter, as he scored a knockdown in round five off a slick combination on his way to a 12-round unanimous decision victory. Just under five months later, he fougth Dixon Flores for the WBA Inter-Continental super flyweight title. Flores may have been a game opponent, but he proved no match for Khalid Yafai, who destroyed him for a first-round KO.\nHe would fight three more times in 2016, which ended up being a banner year for him. First, he scored another first-round stoppage, this a TKO over Jozsef Ajtai. He followed that up by defeating Johnson Tellez by TKO in the third round, with this finish coming from a body shot. That set up a fight for his first world title, the WBA super flyweight belt.\nThe fight took place on December 10, 2016 against Luis Concepcion, who brought a 35-4 record into the bout. After Concepcion missed weight, the title was only on the line for Yafai, and he took it with a dominant 12-round unanimous decision where he controlled every round.",

  "description": "Born on June 17, 1987 in Managua, Nicaragua, Roman Gonzalez is an electrifying fighter with lightning-fast combinations and excellent punching power, particularly for a boxer his size. He made his professional debut just weeks after turning 18, knocking out Ramon Urbina in the second round on July 1, 2005. His fights all took place in his home of Nicaragua for the early portion of his career, as he built up a record of 14-0, collecting the WBA Fedecentro and Nicaraguan light flyweight titles, and then the WBA Fedelatin minimumweight title. Gonzalez had his first fight outside of Nicaragua on November 3, 2007 against Eriberto Gejon in Tokyo, Japan. Fans didn\u2019t get to see him for long, but he did make an impression by scoring a beautiful first-round KO.\nIt wasn\u2019t until his 17th fight that he saw the scorecards, winning a unanimous decision over Hiroshi Matsumoto after 10 rounds. On September 15, 2008, he got his first world title fight when he took on Yutaka Niida for the WBA minimumweight belt. He was far too much for his opponent to handle, winning in dominant fashion by fourth-round TKO. After multiple defenses of his title, Roman Gonzalez jumped up to light flyweight on October 24, 2010 to fight Francisco Rosas for the WBA interim title. He took the belt with a second-round KO. The WBA promoted him to its full champion in February of 2011, and he defended it three times by the end of that year.\nWith his strong performances in multiple weight classes and his high-level technical skills, Gonzalez started getting recognition as one of the world\u2019s top pound-for-pound boxers. While he may not have had the biggest names, the fans who watched him appreciated his aggressive style that often led to a finish.\nAfter several title defenses that brought his record up to 39-0, Roman Gonzalez made another jump in weight, going up to flyweight to fight Akira Yaegashi for the WBC, The Ring, and lineal belts. The fight took place on September 5, 2014, and it was another decisive victory for Gonzalez as he won by TKO in the ninth round. He defended those belts over the next year and a half, even getting a chance to showcase his talents at Madison Square Garden with a ninth-round TKO over Brian Viloria.\nOn September 10, 2016, he went up in weight again when he fought the 35-0-1 Carlos Cuadras for the WBC super flyweight title. It wound up being a close, fast-paced fight, with both boxers having their moments. In the end, though, Gonzalez won by unanimous decision after 12 rounds. With his victory, he made history by becoming Nicaragua\u2019s first four-weight world champion, breaking the tie he had with his mentor and friend Alexis Arguello.\nHe had built up a 46-0 record, but he suffered his first loss in his next fight, dropping a majority decision to Srisaket Sor Rungvisai. It was a stunning upset that many didn\u2019t agree with. The judges scored it 114-112, 114-112, and 113-113 even though Roman Gonzalez landed more punches at a higher accuracy rate, and out landed his opponent in 10 out of 12 rounds.",

  "description": "A slick Cuban boxer who has been successful both as an amateur and a professional, Guillermo Rigondeaux is a truly impressive talent. Boxing analysts and trainers consider his amateur career among the greatest of all time, as he compiled an incredible record of 463 wins with only 12 losses. Born on September 30, 1980, Rigondeaux stormed onto the international scene in 2000, winning the gold medal at the Sydney Olympics as a bantamweight.\nThe next six years of his amateur career included a huge collection of gold medals. He won the Cuban national championships every year from 2000 to 2006, and he took gold at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, along with the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games in Cartagena. He won gold medals at the World Amateur Boxing Championships twice, at the 2001 event in Belfast and the 2005 event in Mianyang. He added gold medals from the Boxing World Cup in 2002 at Astana, 2005 at Moscow and 2006 at Baku, and he added another Olympic gold medal to his collection with a 2004 victory in Athens.\nGuillermo Rigondeaux twice defected from Cuba, once in 2007 and then again in 2009. After defecting in 2009, he decided to turn professional. He had to leave behind his wife, son and stepson in Cuba.\nHe had his first professional fight against Juan Noriega, earning a third-round TKO victory in a contest he controlled from the opening bell. Two more early TKOs followed against Robert Guillen and Giovanni Andrade, with the latter victory earning him the WBA-NABA super bantamweight title. After running his record to 6-0, he earned himself a shot at the vacant WBA interim super bantamweight title.\nAlthough his title fight against Ricardo Cordoba was a split decision, most observers felt that Rigondeaux won it decisively. He was more aggressive going forward, as he followed that fight up by stopping Willie Casey in the very first round, and then got a shot at the full WBA super bantamweight title against Rico Ramos. He dominated Ramos from the beginning, knocking him down multiple times and scoring a sixth-round KO.\nAfter two defenses, he fought Nonito Donaire in a unification bout, as Donaire had the WBO, The Ring and lineal super bantamweight titles. Since Donaire was ranked number five on the pound-for-pound lists at the time, it was seen as Rigondeaux\u2019s most difficult fight yet. He ended up winning by unanimous decisions, with the scorecards reading 114-113, 115-112 and 116-111. He did get knocked down in the 10th round, but most observers and analysts felt that he had actually won by a much wider margin, as he landed quite a few hard shots and controlled the majority of the contest.\nHe defended his titles multiple times after the Donaire fight, and added another belt to his collection when he defeated Drian Francisco by unanimous decision. That victory earned him the WBC Silver International super bantamweight title. He followed that up by going to Wales and stopping Jazza Dickens in just two rounds for another successful title defense.",

  "description": "Born on April 10, 1993 in Zama, Kanagawa, Japan, Naoya Inoue lives up to his nickname \u201cThe Monster,\u201d as he comes after other fighters with powerful punches, particularly to the body. He put together a successful amateur career, as he won a few junior tournaments in Japan and competed in the 2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships, although he didn\u2019t place. After he didn\u2019t lose in a qualification tournament for the Olympic team, he ended his amateur career with a 75-6 record.\nInoue had his first professional fight on October 2, 2012. Unlike many boxers who start their careers with fights against journeymen, he took on the 16-4-1 Crison Omayao, who was a Filipino champion. Despite the level of competition, he demonstrated his power by knocking out his opponent in the fourth round. In his next fight a few months later, he scored another KO, this one in the very first round.\nHis third opponent was the 17-2-4 Yuki Sano, and Naoya Inoue won that fight by TKO in the 10th and final round. That set him up for a title shot in only the fourth fight of his career, as he took on Ryoichi Taguchi on August 25, 2013 for the Japanese light flyweight title. While this was his first fight to go to a decision, he still put on a show, battering Taguchi with hard shots on his way to a 10-round unanimous decision win.\nOn December 6, 2013, he added another belt to his collection when he took out Jerson Mancio by way of fifth-round TKO for the OPBF light flyweight title. After that, he got his first world title fight, as he was set to fight Adrian Hernandez on April 4, 2014 for the WBC light flyweight belt. Once again, Inoue was dominant, as he finished off his opponent in the sixth round by TKO.\nHe defended that belt one time, against Wittawas Basapean, and won by TKO in the 11th round. Then, he decided to challenge himself by relinquishing his title and jumping up to junior bantamweight to take on Omar Narvaez. Narvaez had an impressive record of 43-1-2, along with the WBO title. It didn\u2019t matter to Inoue, who put Narvaez on the canvas in the first minute of the fight and didn\u2019t let up from there, eventually scoring a knockout in just the second round.\nNaoya Inoue was out of action for almost a year after that, but came back on December 29, 2015 to defend his WBO title for the first time. It didn\u2019t take him long to defeat Warlito Parrenas, as he won by TKO in the second round. On May 8, 2016, he fought David Carmona, who would become just the second fighter to last until a decision against him, but he still picked up the win after 12 rounds. He fought two more times that year. First, he beat Karoon Jarupianlerd in the 10th round by TKO. He then closed out 2016 with another spectacular finish, this one against Kohei Kono in the sixth round of their fight.",

  "description": "Gary Russell Jr. is a professional boxer who was born on June 5, 1988, in Washington, D.C. He knew from a young age that he wanted to have a career in boxing, and that passion paid off handsomely as a teenager. After training throughout most of his childhood, Russell Jr. became one of the best amateur boxers in the country by winning the United States Championships and National Golden Gloves tournaments in 2005 at the age of 16. The dominance in the United States earned him a trip to the 2005 Amateur Boxing World Championships in Mianyang, China. Russell Jr. lost only one fight during the prestigious tournament, but he was still only able to take the bronze medal in the bantamweight division.\nRussell Jr. once again proved that he was the best amateur boxer in his weight class by winning the 2006 U.S Championships. This earned him a trip to the 2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Chicago, but he ultimately lost in the second round. While Gary was able to qualify for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, he never got to compete after missing the final weight-in.\nThe disappointment in Beijing caused Gary Russell Jr. to focus on turning pro. He made his professional boxing debut in a match against Anthony Reyes on January 16, 2009. Russell Jr. won the fight by technical knockout in the third round. After seven straight wins to start the professional career, he fought in his first six-round match against Jairo Delgado on February 19, 2010. He won the fight with a technical knockout in the first round.\nGary Russell Jr. appeared in his first fight scheduled for eight rounds on January 28, 2011. He secured a unanimous technical decision victory over Feider Viloria in the seventh round. The fight was stopped early after Viloria sustained a massive cut from an accidental headbutt. Russell Jr. started his professional career with 18 straight wins before he got to appear in his first 10-round fight. That match occurred on November 26, 2011, against Heriberto Ruiz. While the fight was scheduled to go 10 rounds, Ruiz was knocked out two minutes into the first round.\nAfter starting his professional career with 24 straight wins, Gary Russell Jr. finally got his first world title shot on June 21, 2014. The fight was against Ukraine\u2019s Vasyl Lomachenko for the vacant WBO featherweight title. The Ukrainian was only fighting his third professional match after a record-setting amateur career. Lomachenko dominated most of the fight before winning by a majority decision.\nRussell Jr. did not let the first loss hinder his impressive career. He followed up the loss with a unanimous decision victory over Christopher Martin Pena. This win earned him a shot at Jhonny Gonzalez\u2019s WBC featherweight title on March 28, 2015. Gonzalez was defeated by technical knockout in the fourth round. Gary successfully defended his new WBC featherweight title for the first time against Ireland\u2019s Patrick Hyland at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Montville, Connecticut, on April 16, 2016. Hyland was knocked out in the second round.",

  "description": "Born in Las Vegas, Nevada on November 8, 1991, Jessie Magdaleno comes from an athletic family. Both his brothers boxed, and his father played professional soccer, which he also played as a youth. At seven years old, he decided to start training in boxing because his older brother, Diego, was doing it.\nMagdaleno is right-handed but stands southpaw. He\u2019s about as skilled with his left hand as his right, because he broke his right hand in the fourth grade and learned to write with his left. That dexterity has translated over to the boxing ring, as he has sharp punches that come from all angles.\nJessie Magdaleno had an impressive amateur career, with particularly strong performances at the 2009 U.S. National Championships and the 2009 National Golden Glove Championships. He took gold at both of those tournaments.\nWhile he would have been a contender to win gold at the 2012 Olympics, he was disenchanted with all the judging issues that seemed to occur at every Olympics, so he instead decided to turn pro in 2010. He ended his amateur career with a record of 120-16.\nHis first fight was on November 6, 2010, two days before he turned 19. He took on Matthew Salazar and won by TKO in the first round. He looked like he had been shot out of a cannon, as he came out fast with flurries of punches to get the stoppage. It worked, but it wouldn\u2019t in longer fights, and that\u2019s why his trainer taught him how to slow down and pick his spots better. That whirlwind style may be successful in the amateurs, but not in the pros.\nIn his next fight, he was more measured and defeated Cain Garcia by a third-round TKO. Against Sergio Herrera, he picked up another first-round TKO.\nFor his next two fights, Magdaleno proved that he could go the distance, as he defeated Jonathan Alcantara and Esteban Nichol each by unanimous decision after six rounds. After an active 2011 and 2012, he got his first title shot to close out the year on December 6, 2012. He fought Jonathan Arrellano for the WBO NABO Youth super bantamweight title and picked up win by unanimous decision after eight rounds.\nThat was his first decision win after a streak of four straight victories by KO or TKO, with three of those coming in the first round. He then went on another streak of stoppages, picking up three in a row, although he was out of action from the middle of 2013 until early 2016. Still, his excellent performances earned him a shot at the WBO super bantamweight title.\nThat title fight was on November 5, 2016 against the highly skilled boxer Nonito Donaire. Jessie Magdaleno shocked many observers by coming out strong to open the fight, putting together an early lead. Being a five-division champion, Donaire fought back hard and even nearly picked up a stoppage in the 12th and final round. It wasn\u2019t enough, though, as Magdaleno won the unanimous decision to pick up the belt and run his record to 24-0.",

  "description": "Born on August 10 1988 in Huetamo, Michoacan, Mexico, Leo Santa Cruz started boxing at a young age, like many of the great Mexican fighters. Although he didn\u2019t win any major international tournaments, he did put together an impressive amateur record of 148-7.\nShortly after turning 20, Santa Cruz fought in his first professional boxing match. On October 13, 2006, he took on Pedro Silva, who he defeated by knockout in the second round. He wasn\u2019t as successful in his subsequent bout, as he fought Rodrigo Hernandez to a majority draw after four rounds.\nDespite that minor setback, he started putting together a winning streak over the next several years. Most his victories were by unanimous decision, but towards the end of 2009, he started learning how to put more pop into his punches. On November 3, 2009, he blasted Julio Valadez for a first-round KO. He followed that up with three TKO victories in a row. While none of those were against high-level fighters, his next fight was against the 20-2 Stephane Jamoye for the WBC Youth interim bantamweight title. Leo Santa Cruz took it to the veteran fighter, picking up a KO win in the sixth round.\nHe brought his record to 19-0-1, with nine consecutive stoppages, when he fought Vusi Malinga on June 2, 2012 for the IBF bantamweight title. In his first world title fight, Santa Cruz controlled the proceedings from beginning to end, earning a unanimous decision victory after 12 rounds. He would defend that belt three times before making the decision to go up in weight to the super bantamweight division.\nMaking his debut at his new weight class on May 4, 2013, he beat Alexander Munoz by way of fifth-round TKO, winning the USBA super bantamweight belt in the process. His next fight was even more impressive, as he beat Victor Terrazas by TKO in the third round to add the WBC super bantamweight belt to his collection. He made four title defenses before moving up in weight again, this time to the featherweight division.\nLeo Santa Cruz announced him to the world in his featherweight debut, in no small part because it was occurring on the blockbuster Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight card, which shattered every pay-per-view record. He took full advantage, cruising to a 10-round unanimous decision victory. His next fight was for the WBA featherweight title on August 29, 2015 against Abner Mares. In a classic contest, both men fought hard, but Santa Cruz was able to edge out a majority decision win, staying on the outside just enough to keep himself out of danger.\nHe defended that belt once by beating Kiko Martinez in a slugfest, eventually picking up the fifth-round TKO. However, in his next attempted defense on July 30, 2016, he would lose his belt to Carl Frampton by majority decision in a very close fight. He got a shot at redemption on January 28, 2017 and took full advantage. Although he only won by majority decision, he landed far more punches and got the WBA belt back.",

  "description": "Representing Northern Ireland, Carl Frampton made history as the first boxer from that region to win world titles in two weight divisions. He has picked up numerous championships and accolades over successful amateur and professional careers.\nBorn February 21, 1987 in Tiger\u2019s Bay, Belfast, Frampton began his career training at the Midland Boxing Club. He was successful as an amateur early on, winning the Irish senior flyweight title in 2005. In 2007, he competed in the featherweight division at the European Union Amateur Boxing Championships, which were held in Dublin. He fought his way to the final\u2019s, where he was defeated by Khedafi Djeklhir out of France, ending the tournament with the silver medal. In 2009, he won the Irish featherweight title and decided to end his amateur career with that victory. His amateur record was superb at 114 wins with only 11 losses.\nCarl Frampton made his professional debut shortly after that tournament on June 12, 2009. He fought in England, where he would end up fighting many times over the years, and he faced off against Sandor Szinavel. He scored a second-round TKO victory, announcing himself on the scene in a big way. With two more victories before the end of the year, the Irish National Boxing Awards named him the nation\u2019s prospect of the year early in 2010. He continued to live up to the hype, collecting three more victories before he put on his most impressive performance to that point, stopping Yuri Voronin in a thrilling contest on September 18, 2010.\nThree months later, Frampton was fighting for his first title, this one the vacant British Celtic super-bantamweight belt. He came ready to fight and took out Gavin Reid by way of second-round TKO. By September of 2011, he was adding another belt to his collection. Fighting as a replacement for Kiko Martinez, he scored a fourth-round TKO of Mark Quon to win the vacant Commonwealth super-bantamweight title. He followed that up with two successful defenses of that belt, which earned him a shot for the vacant IBF Inter-Continental super-bantamweight title.\nHe was undefeated at the time, as was his opponent, Ra\u00fal Hirales Jr., a hard-nosed Mexican fighter. In another impressive performance, he controlled the fight from start to finish and ended up with a unanimous decision win. He then defeated Steve Molitor by sixth-round TKO.\nHis next fight, taking place on February 9, 2013, was for the European super-bantamweight title, and it was against the dangerous Spanish fighter Kiko Mart\u00ednez, known for his excellent punching power and his granite chin. Mart\u00ednez had just taken out Bernard Dunne in only 86 seconds to win that European super-bantamweight title, and no man had ever been able to even knock him down in his career. Carl Frampton had scored quite a few TKOs to that point, but he wasn\u2019t known as a power puncher, which is why it was surprising to many when he finished his opponent in the ninth-round by TKO. What made it even sweeter was that he did so in Belfast, in front of his home-town fans.\nHe tore through his next two opponents, first knocking out Jeremy Parodi in the sixth round, and then knocking out Hugo C\u00e1zares with a beautiful left hook in just the second round. That set him up for a shot at the IBF super-bantamweight title, which was somewhat ironically held by a man he had recently defeated in Kiko Mart\u00ednez. Their rematch took place on September 6, 2014, once again in Belfast but this time in an open-air arena. This time around, he scored a knockdown in the fifth round and cruised to a dominant unanimous decision victory, with the final scorecards reading 119-108, 119-108 and 118-111.\nThe Irish boxer defended his title with a brutal beating of Mexican-American boxer Chris Avalos, stopping him in the fifth round. His next fight, which was his first in the United States, proved to be far more difficult. Although he was a significant favorite over Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez Jr., the Mexican fighter knocked him down twice in the very first round, and it looked like there might be an upset brewing. However, Frampton stormed back and took control of an electrifying fight. He won a unanimous decision, with the final score cards reading 116-108, 116-108 and 115-109.\nHis next fight was February 27, 2016 against an opponent he had called out several years prior \u2013 Scott Quigg, an undefeated British fighter who held the WBA super-bantamweight title. At the beginning of the fight, it looked like he would run away with it, as he controlled all the action and evaded Quigg\u2019s punches. In the second half, Quigg made it more of a brawl and the two men traded heavy leather. It was close, but Frampton left with both belts, winning a split decision with scores of 116-112, 116-112 and 113-115.\nWhen he didn\u2019t negotiate a fight with mandatory title challenger Guillermo Rigondeaux, the WBA stripped him of that WBA super-bantamweight title that he had just won. However, he had decided to make a jump in weight class, choosing to take on the undefeated Mexican fighter L\u00e9o Santa Cruz. The fight took place on July 30, 2016 in New York City\u2019s Barclays Centre, making it his second fight on U.S. soil. In another thrilling contest that many called the fight of the year, he pulled out a close majority decision victory, with scores of 116-112, 117-111 and 114-114. The punch stats showed how close the fight was, as Frampton connected on 242 out of 668 punches for an accuracy rate of 36 percent, while Santa Cruz landed 255 out of his 1,002 punches for 25-percent accuracy. With his victory, he ended 2016 as the Fighter of the Year according to The Ring, ESPN and the Boxing Writers Association of America.\nFor such a close fight, a rematch was inevitable. This time around, the result was the opposite, as Santa Cruz scored a win by majority decision, throwing and landing far more punches throughout the contest. The final margin was razor thin, with Santa Cruz winning 115-113, 115-113 and 114-114.",

  "description": "Born on December 22, 1990 in Nogales, Sonora, Oscar Valdez embodies the Mexican fighting style with his aggressiveness, as he continually comes forward and drills his opponents with sharp combinations. He had a solid amateur career, as he qualified for the 2008 Olympics when he was only 17. He didn\u2019t medal, although he had the misfortune of facing the eventual gold medalist in his first match. In the 2008 AIBA Youth World Boxing Championships, he took gold. He also claimed the gold medal at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games. Competing in the Olympics again in 2012, he had more success, winning two matches, but still failed to medal.\nValdez decided to turn pro after that and had his first fight on November 3, 2012 against Angel Prado. It took him only two rounds to win the fight by TKO, as he showed off his considerable punching power. He fought again just over a month later, and the result was the same, a second-round TKO victory over Corben Page. After a couple months off, he fought on March 16, 2013 against Carlos Gonzalez, picking up a fourth-round TKO.\nWith the young boxer\u2019s aggressive fighting style, high pace, and heavy hands, it made sense why Oscar Valdez put so many opponents away. His first nine fights were TKO victories, which earned him a shot at the NABF Junior super featherweight title on April 12, 2014 against the 10-4-1 Adrian Perez. He didn\u2019t get the TKO this time \u2013 it was a KO, instead, as he showed off his knack for body shots with an excellent left hand dug right into the liver, and a right hand after it to seal the deal. Perez dropped to the ground, and although he was conscious, he was too badly hurt to even attempt to get up.\nAfter one title defense which was another victory inside the distance, Valdez fought for the NABF Junior featherweight belt on July 26, 2014. He fought Juan Ruiz, who became the first boxer to take him to a decision. Oscar Valdez still won all eight rounds, though. He picked up where he left off after that, knocking out three more fighters and then winning a 10-round unanimous decision over Ruben Tamayo. With another two TKOs, he had built his record up to 18-0, and for that he got a chance to fight for the WBO-NABO featherweight title on April 9, 2016 against Evgeny Gradovich, who was 21-1-1 at the time. In a brutal beatdown, Valdez took control from the very beginning on his way to a fourth-round TKO.\nWith that win, he got his first shot at a world title, the WBO featherweight belt on July 23, 2016 against the 26-0 Matias Rueda. He used terrific body work to score two knockdowns in the first two rounds, and on the second, the referee waved off the fight. In the biggest fight of his life and against an undefeated opponent, Valdez showed his tremendous talent and finishing ability. He closed out 2016 with another TKO, this one in the seventh round against Hiroshige Osawa to defend his belt.",

  "description": "Born on June 11, 1989 in Manchester, England, Terry Flanagan is a skilled southpaw who started boxing at 7 years old. Since he was small for his age and fought up in weight quite often, he had an unspectacular amateur career. He won about as many as he lost, and didn\u2019t pick up any tournament medals. Feeling like his style was better suited for the longer rounds of professional fighting, he made the leap to the professional ranks when he was 19.\nFlanagan had his pro debut on January 24, 2009 in a six-round fight against Danny McDermid. He cruised to an easy win on points. He ended up winning his first four fights on the scorecards, before picking up his first finish to close out 2009 when he beat Delroy Spencer by TKO in the third round. He followed that up with a first-round KO over Csaba Toth and a second-round TKO over Ignac Kassai.\nWhile Terry Flanagan demonstrated solid technical skills and decent punching power over the early portion of his career, he was fighting a low level of competition, which is common for young British fighters. Still, he was staying active and getting the job done. After he had built up a perfect 13-0 record, he got a chance to fight Dougie Curran for the English super featherweight title on May 18, 2012. It was definitely a fight he was supposed to win, as Curran was 5-11-2 at the time and had already lost to him once before. Flanagan took care of business with a unanimous decision win after 10 rounds. He defended the title against Troy James a few months later.\nHe then decided to give the Prizefighter lightweight tournament a try. He fought three times on October 6, 2012, just weeks after his fight against James, but he managed to win three straight fights by decision to win the tournament. After keeping his win streak going and his undefeated record intact, he fought Martin Gethin on July 26, 2014 for the British lightweight title. He dished out a beating, and Gethin didn\u2019t come out after the seventh round.\nAfter taking out Danny Little by fifth-round TKO, Terry Flanagan took on Stephen Ormond for the WBO European lightweight title. He was ahead on all the scorecards when his opponent was disqualified for repeated headbutts.\nIn his next fight on July 11, 2015, he got his first shot at a world title when he took on Jose Zepeda for the WBO lightweight belt. It was a bit unlucky for his Zepeda, who dislocated his shoulder and couldn\u2019t come out after the second round.\nFlanagan made his first defense of his new title in Manchester against Diego Magdaleno, and he put on a show for his hometown fans, blasting his opponent and winning in the second round by TKO. He followed that up with two unanimous decision victories after 12 rounds. In his last fight of 2016, he dominated Orlando Cruz on the way to an eighth-round TKO win, taking his record to 32-0 in the process.",

  "description": "A skilled fighter who has won both amateur and professional titles, Luke Campbell was born on September 27, 1987 in Hull, East Yorkshire, England. A soft-spoken southpaw who is known for sharp counterpunching, he has boxing in his genes, as his grandfather was an Irish champion.\nCampbell began his training when he set foot in St. Paul\u2019s Amateur Boxing Club at 13 years of age. His first major achievement was winning the English senior ABA bantamweight title in 2007, which he repeated in 2008. He took gold as a bantamweight at the 2008 European Amateur Boxing Championships, and followed that up with a bronze medal at the 2009 EU Championships. After collecting a silver medal at the 2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships, he earned a chance to compete at the 2012 Olympics. While he had close matches in the quarters, semis and the finals, he won them all to take the gold medal.\nHe turned pro on July 13, 2013 when he fought Andy Harris in Hull, in front of his hometown fans. He scored a dominant first-round TKO victory. His next fight was against Neil Hepper in October, and this time it was a first-round KO. Less than a month later he was fighting again and scoring another finish, this time in the fifth round against Lee Connelly.\nChuck Jones became the first fighter to take Campbell to a decision, but the slick southpaw won on points after four rounds. He then stopped Scott Moises in the eighth round, making him the first man to ever accomplish that.\nLuke Campbell said he needed to take time off from boxing in April of 2014 because his father had cancer. However, he ended up fighting another four times that year, earning one decision win and three stoppages, which ran his record to 9-0.\nAfter two more excellent TKO victories, he got his first title fight. He fought Tommy Coyle on August 1, 2015 in Hull for the WBC international lightweight title. In a beautiful performance, he knocked Coyle down multiple times throughout the contest before scoring a TKO in the 10th round to take the belt.\nHowever, Campbell would end up losing that belt in his very next fight against Yvan Mendy. In a poor defensive performance, he got dropped for the first time in his career and ended up losing a close split decision.\nHe got right back into action three months later against Gary Sykes, and won the Commonwealth lightweight title by way of second-round TKO. His next fight was against Argenis Mendez for the WBC Silver lightweight title. Despite a defensive lapse in the second round that resulted in him getting dropped, he took over the rest of the fight and cruised to a unanimous decision win.\nLuke Campbell showed off his power in his next performance, as he took out Derry Mathews with a vicious KO in the fourth round. He raised the bar even higher for his next fight, as he dropped Jairo Lopez in round one, and then finished him with a crushing uppercut in round two.",

  "description": "Gervonta Davis is a professional boxer who was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on November 7, 1994. Avoiding the dangerous streets is crucial for young kids in Baltimore when they are not in school, so Davis\u2019 family allowed him to spend his free time at a local boxing gym. His training started at the age of five at the Upton Boxing Center, which was owned and operated by local celebrity Calvin Ford. The HBO show \u201cThe Wire\u201d based the character Dennis Wise on Ford.\nThe great training helped Gervonta Davis have an accomplished amateur boxing career. He won his first National Silver Gloves Championship in 2006 at the age of 12. He also won the tournament in 2007 and 2008. Davis added two gold medals at the Junior Olympics during this time too. Davis went through a minor adjustment period when he started facing older boxers, but he returned to prominence when he won the National Gold Gloves Championship in 2012.\nAfter finishing his amateur career with a 206-15 record, Gervonta Davis made his professional debut on February 22, 2013. The match against Desi Williams was scheduled to go four rounds, but Williams was knocked out less than two minutes into the first round. Davis fought a total of six matches in 2013, and he easily won every fight with a knockout. He had his first competitive professional fight when he took on German Meraz on October 8, 2014. While Davis was forced to box six rounds for the first time in his career, he still came away with the unanimous decision victory.\nThe win over Meraz set up a match against extremely accomplished Puerto Rican boxer Israel Suarez on February 20, 2015. Suarez entered the fight with an impressive resume, but Gervonta Davis knocked him out after only 47 seconds in the first round. Gervonta got another quick first round knockout in his next fight against Alberto Mora on May 22, 2015. Suarez and Mora were both knocked out for the first time in their career.\nThe impressive string of knockout victories gave Davis the opportunity to fight for a large audience on television for the first time in his career. His fight against Recky Dulay was on the undercard of the pay-per-view event showcasing the match between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Andre Berto on September 12, 2015. Dulay entered the match with an impressive 8-1 record, but he was also knocked out in the first round.\nGervonta got the chance to fight a former world title holder for the first time when he faced Cristobal Cruz on October 30, 2015. Cruz was clearly entering the end of his career, so he did not put up much of a threat before losing by technical knockout in the third round. Davis won 15 of his first 16 professional fights by knockout before getting his first world title shot on January 14, 2017. The match was for Jose Pedraza\u2019s IBF junior lightweight title. Both boxers entered the match undefeated, but the champion ultimately got dethroned by technical knockout in the seventh round.",

  "description": "Born on January 26, 1991 in Toledo, Ohio, Robert Easter Jr. came from a boxing family. His grandfather taught his father, uncles, and aunt the sport, and he was boxing as a young child. He put together an extremely impressive amateur career, although he never managed to win a national title, typically reaching either the semis of the finals before losing. Still, he finished his amateur career with a record of 213-17 and was an alternate for the 2012 U.S. Olympic Boxing team. After receiving a training camp invitation from Adrien Broner, he decided to turn pro.\nEaster had his first professional fight on November 10, 2012 against Eddie Corona, and his power was apparent from the get-go as he picked up a TKO win in the second round. He followed that up less than a month later with a first-round KO over David Castillo. Although he won his fight against Jose Valderrama on February 16, 2013 by stoppage after the first round, he wasn\u2019t happy with his performance, as he felt like he was trying too hard to get the knockout.\nDespite his own criticisms, the rangy Easter was an excellent prospect, as he had a slick style honed by his hundreds of amateur fights, along with the power to put opponents away. His sixth fight against the 11-8-1 Lowell Brownfield was his first fight against an opponent with a winning record, but it didn\u2019t make a difference, as he scored a sharp second-round KO. By the end of 2013, Robert Easter Jr. had built up an 8-0 record with every win coming by stoppage and none of them going past the third round.\nHis first two fights of 2014 was also his first two fights to see the scorecards, and even though he didn\u2019t get the finish either time, he did win two clear-cut unanimous decisions after eight rounds. He followed that up with a first-round KO of Roberto Acevedo on September 6, 2014, and then had his longest fight to date when he beat Angel Hernandez by unanimous decision after 10 rounds.\nAlthough his level of competition got higher, Robert Easter Jr. was improving along with it, and he had a dominant 2015. He fought four times that year and won each fight by either KO or TKO, including two finishes in the second round. His string of excellent performances and perfect 16-0 record earned him his first big fight on April 1, 2016, when he took on the 23-3-1 Argenis Mendez, who had been the IBF super featherweight champion. Easter showed that he could get the finish against a skilled veteran, as he battered his opponent on the way to a fifth-round TKO.\nOn September 9, 2016, he had his first title fight, for the IBF lightweight belt against the 24-0 Richard Commey. It was a close fight with two high-level fighters going at it, but this time around, Easter was the one who walked away with the title. He won by split decision after 12 rounds. He followed that up with a unanimous decision over Luis Cruz.",

  "description": "Felix Verdejo is a professional boxer who was born on May 19, 1993. He spent most of his childhood living in a home in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with his two sisters and two brothers. Felix became the first person in the family to pick up the sport of boxing when he began training at a local gym at the age of nine.\nAfter training for more than 10 years, Verdejo finally started entering national boxing tournaments in 2012. Winning the 2012 American Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament in Rio de Janeiro ensured that he would be a member of the Puerto Rican Olympic boxing team. Verdejo defeated Panama\u2019s Jose Huertas and Tunisia\u2019s Ahmed Mejri in the first two rounds of the 2012 Olympic Games in London before losing to Ukraine\u2019s Vasyl Lomenchenko in the quarterfinal round.\nThe solid showing at the Olympics convinced Felix Verdejo that he should start his professional boxing career. His first professional fight took place on December 6, 2012, at The Mirage in Las Vegas. Verdejo defeated Leonardo Chavez by unanimous decision. The first professional win was then followed up with five straight knockout victories. After winning his first nine matches, Verdejo got the chance to fight in one of the most historic arenas in the world. He secured a first round knockout victory over Lauro Alcantar in Madison Square Garden on January 15, 2014. Six months later, he had another first round knockout win over Engelberto Valenzuela in the same building.\nFelix Verdejo finally had his first fight get past the fourth round when he faced Oscar Bravo on August 16, 2014. While Verdejo was challenged for the first time in his career, he still walked away with a unanimous decision victory in the eight-round bout. He ended 2014 with knockout victories over Sergio Villanueva and Karim El Ouazghari to finish the year with a perfect 17-0 professional record. The impressive start to his career let Felix Verdejo fight Marco Antonio Lopez for the vacant WBO Latino lightweight title on April 25, 2015. Lopez struggled to land punches before getting knocked out in the fifth round.\nVerdejo successfully defended his new title for the first time when he got a unanimous decision victory over Ivan Najera on June 13, 2015. He finally got to box in front of his hometown fans of San Juan when he took on Josenilson Dos Santos at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum on December 11, 2015. Dos Santos struggled from the opening bell, and he was eventually knocked out late in the second round. The WBO Latino lightweight title was also successfully defended against William Silva, Jose Luis Rodriguez and Juan Jose Martinez before the end of 2016.\nFelix Verdejo\u2019s career looked like it could be in jeopardy when he got into a serious motorcycle accident in August 2016. The accident forced him to stay in the hospital for 12 days before fully recovering from a head injury. He returned to the ring for the first time after the accident on February 3, 2017, to defeat Oliver Flores by unanimous decision. ",

  "description": "Born on May 18, 1986 in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England, Liam Walsh is a southpaw fighter with solid technical skills, excellent cardio and the heart to keep going even during the toughest fights.\nWalsh didn\u2019t have the lengthy amateur career of many fighters, and he went pro a few months before his 22nd birthday. He first fought on February 2, 2008 on a card headlined by popular British boxer Amir Khan. His twin brother, Ryan, and his older brother, Michael, both also made their professional boxing debuts on the same card, and it was a good night for the family, as all three scored victories. Liam took on the 22-69-3 Daniel Thorpe and finished the fight early, dropping Thorpe with a right hand for a first-round KO.\nIn his next fight on June 14, 2008, he knocked his opponent out again, this time taking out Johnny Geaves in the fourth round. He followed that up with a victory on points after four rounds against Youssef Al Hamidi, and then went on a streak of five straight victories by way of TKO. While Liam Walsh was winning impressively, his opponents were anything but impressive, as all of them had losing records.\nOn September 24, 2010, he faced his first opponent with a winning record in the 8-5-2 Sebastien Cornu, whom he beat on points after six rounds. That set him up for a shot at the Commonwealth super featherweight title just under a month later against Maxwell Awuku, who had a record of 20-1-1. In a difficult, back-and-forth fight, he ended up winning by unanimous decision after 12 rounds.\nHe scored a 10th-round KO in his first title defense, but had a far tougher time in his second defense, which was against Paul Appleby. The two men went toe to toe, and Walsh got dropped in the seventh round. However, he fought back and ended up earning the stoppage after 10 rounds to keep his belt.\nAfter that gritty performance, he fought Domenico Urbano on July 14, 2012 for the WBO European lightweight title and took the belt home with a dominant TKO victory in the eighth round. He made multiple title defenses over 2013 and 2014, and then added the British super featherweight title to his collection with a 12-round unanimous decision victory over Gary Sykes on November 29, 2014.\nHe stopped Joe Murray by fifth-round TKO in a title defense at the 02 Arena, which was a strong showing in a rematch of a close fight that Liam Walsh won by majority decision. On July 11, 2015, Walsh fought Isaias Santos Sampaio for the WBO Inter-Continental lightweight title and had another great performance, knocking out his opponent in the sixth round. He went back to super featherweight to defend his belts against Troy James, and notched another stoppage victory, this one a TKO in the eighth round. He kept his undefeated record alive when he fought Andrey Klimov on October 8, 2016, winning a unanimous decision after 12 rounds and bringing his record to 21-0 in the process.",

  "description": "Born on August 22, 1985 in Barinas, Venezuela, Jorge Linares came from humble beginnings, as he lived in a small town and his family didn\u2019t have much. While he was also good at running and volleyball, his father told him that he should stick with boxing. As an amateur, he won gold at two tournaments in 1999, Venezuela\u2019s Juniors National Championship and Juniors Venezuela Panama Dual. He won the silver medal the next year at the National Championship, and then won gold again at the Juniors National Championship in 2001. By the time he finished his amateur career, he had an excellent record of 89-5.\nGetting the opportunity to box professionally over in Japan, Linares snatched it up and began his career at just 17 years old on December 15, 2002. He fought Kyong-Soo Chung and won by KO in the first round. Fighting on small shows around Japan and taking on journeyman fighters, he took his record to 7-0 before he got a chance to fight for the WBA Fedelatin super bantamweight title in his home country. It took place on January 31, 2004 against Hugo Rafael Soto, and he ended up winning by unanimous decision after 10 rounds.\nHis next three fighters were in Tokyo, as he picked up a unanimous decision over Michael Domingo, a unanimous decision over Renan Acosta to win the WBA Fedelatin featherweight title, and a first-round KO over Sung-Hoon Park. After three more stoppage victories, he beat Jean Javier Sotelo on May 26, 2005 to pick up the WBA Fedecentro featherweight title.\nJorge Linares was showing improvements in his technique every time he stepped into the ring, and after building a 23-0 record, he got his first shot at a world title. It came against Oscar Larios on July 21, 2007, and with a 10th-round TKO he won the WBC featherweight title.\nAfter defending that belt once, he made the move to super featherweight, where he won the WBA title with a fifth-round TKO over Whyber Garcia. He defended this belt once before suffering a huge upset when he was beaten by first-round TKO against Juan Carlos Salgado.\nLinares took some time off and rebounded on March 27, 2010 with a majority decision win over Francisco Lorenzo. A four-fight winning streak earned him a shot at the WBC lightweight title, but despite a strong performance in that fight against Antonio DeMarco, he was stopped in the 11th-round because of a bad cut on his nose. In his next fight, he was stopped again, this time by Sergio Thompson by way of second-round TKO.\nWith consecutive losses for the first time in his career, Jorge Linares took just over six months off and came back on October 7, 2012 to beat Hector Velazquez by unanimous decision. He won six fights in a row to get another shot at the WBC lightweight title, and this time he came through with a fourth-round KO over Javier Prieto. After two title defenses, Linares then beat Anthony Croalla by unanimous decision to win the WBA and The Ring lightweight titles.",

  "description": "Born on February 14, 1987 in Barry, Wales, Lee Selby was brought up in a boxing family. His father loved boxing and encouraged his three sons to pick up the sport, and although Lee started out with Tae Kwon Do, he soon made the transition to boxing. He had his first amateur fight when he was 10 years old, although he didn\u2019t win any major tournaments over the course of his amateur career.\nSelby experienced a personal tragedy the same year that he debuted as a professional. His older brother, Michael got drunk and fell over a bridge. He drowned and his body was found several days later. Lee started smoking and drinking heavily to cope with the pain, but eventually pulled himself together and decided he would fight hard for both himself and his late brother.\nHis professional debut came on July 12, 2008 against Sid Razak, and he picked up a win on points after six rounds. He would win his next three fights on points, as well. However, he hit a bump in the road on May 29, 2009, as he lost on points to Samir Mouneimne. He didn\u2019t let that stop him, though, and on August 10, 2009 he bounced back with a points win over Ian Bailey. He then scored two more wins on points, with the latter being an impressive victory over the 10-1-1 Ben Jones.\nFor that performance, Lee Selby got a shot at the British Welsh Area featherweight title on October 30, 2010 against Dai Davies. Even though it was a title fight, Davies wasn\u2019t a particularly impressive opponent, sporting a poor record of 6-13-1. To his credit, Lee scored the first stoppage victory of his career, winning by KO in the second round.\nSelby seemed to turn a corner after this victory. While he wasn\u2019t a power puncher, he started doing more damage in his fights and winning by stoppage more often instead of scraping by on points each time. At one point, he had a streak of four straight victories by TKO or KO, during which time he collected the British Celtic, British and Commonwealth featherweight titles.\nOn July 13, 2013, he fought the 16-0 Viorel Simion for the WBC International featherweight title. It was a competitive contest, but he pulled out a razor-thin unanimous decision to win the belt. After another unanimous decision win, this one over Ryan Walsh, he picked up the European featherweight title when he beat Rendall Munroe by TKO in the sixth round.\nAfter running his record to 20-1, Lee Selby earned a shot at a world title, in this case the IBF featherweight belt. The fight was on May 30, 2015 against Evgeny Gradovich, who was undefeated. He controlled the action up until the eighth round, when an accidental clash of heads resulted in a cut to Gradovich. The fight went to the scorecards, where Selby was declared the victor. He defended the title against Fernando Montiel a few months later and won by unanimous decision. In his post-fight interview, he dedicated the fight to a friend of his who had recently died from attempting to eat an entire burger in one bite.",

  "description": "Born on February 17, 1988 in Ukraine, Vasyl Lomachenko is an incredibly technically-sound southpaw who ranks among the most accomplished amateur boxers in history. He started training early in his life since his father was a boxing trainer. In the 2007 World Championships, he made it to the finals, but came away with the silver medal after losing to Albert Selimov. He would go on to beat Selimov twice to avenge the loss, which ended up being the only loss of his entire amateur career.\nLomachenko put on a show at the 2008 Olympics, dominating every bout to win gold and get the Val Barker Trophy for the most outstanding boxer in the tournament. He took gold at the next two World Championships in 2009 and 2011, and then brought home another gold medal at the 2012 Olympics. When he finished his amateur career, he had a stunning record of 396 victories and only that one loss.\nAfter the 2012 Olympics, Vasyl Lomachenko decided to take the next step in his career. From January to May of 2013, he competed in the World Series of Boxing, which is technically still considered amateur competition, although it has rules similar to professional boxing. He won all six fights in that organization, and then had his official pro debut on October 12, 2013 against Jose Ramirez. While most fighters take on journeymen to start their careers, that wasn\u2019t the case for Lomachenko, whose amateur credentials resulted in fights against tough opponents from the beginning. He took out the 25-3 Ramirez in a beautiful performance, winning by TKO in the fourth round and getting the WBO International featherweight title in the process.\nHis next fight was fraught with controversy. He was aiming to make history by winning a world title, in this case the WBO featherweight title, in just his second fight. The record was held by Saensak Muangsurin, who did so in his third pro fight. His opponent, Orlando Salido, didn\u2019t make weight and had an 11-pound weight advantage on fight night. Throughout the fight, the referee did little as Salido connected on numerous low blows. Despite a late surge by Lomachenko, he wasn\u2019t aggressive enough through most of the bout and lost a majority decision.\nHe tied Muangsurin\u2019s record in his next fight, when he beat the 24-0 Gary Russell Jr on June 21, 2014 to win the WBO featherweight title. It was a difficult fight against a skilled opponent, but he managed to pull out a majority decision. In his next fight, he defeated Chonlatarn Piriyapinyo by unanimous decision after 12 rounds.\nVasyl Lomachenko defended his belt two more times, winning by knockout each time. On June 11, 2016, he jumped up to junior lightweight to take on Roman Martinez for the WBO title. His skills were far too much for Martinez to handle, as he dominated from the beginning, eventually picking up the win by KO in the fifth round. In his first title defense, Lomachenko had another spectacular performance as he beat down Nicholas Walters, who quit on his stool after the seventh round.",
